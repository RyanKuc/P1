To complete P1, I opted to use the Bootstrap front end framework based on its responsive design and because I had never used it before. I reviewed some of the examples they had on their site and felt that the carousel example they displayed would be a good fit for my portfolio page. Some of the modifications I made include:
* Stripping the template of any extra code for their testing purposes
* Updating the nav to include dropdown menus for all my projects 
* Changing the color scheme for the carousel
* Removing the extra heading divs around my profile picture and then adjusting the layout to keep it responsive
* Adding content and links to external pages, updated source links
* Modified carousel.css for several things like ensuring my text and pictures align vertically
